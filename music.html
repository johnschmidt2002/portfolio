                        <h2 class="fw-bolder">Overview</h2>
                        <p>This research project explored the relationship between economic hardship and music preferences. I aimed to answer a simple yet profound question: During tough economic times, do people tend to listen to happier or sadder music? Understanding this could provide insight into how individuals use music as an emotional coping mechanism during financial stress.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder">Approach</h2>
                        <p>To tackle this question, I developed a model using Python and employed data analysis techniques. I gathered data on music streaming trends and economic indicators such as unemployment rates and stock market performance. Using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I analyzed listening trends during periods of economic downturn. Sentiment analysis was applied to classify songs as either "happy" or "sad," based on lyrics and musical features.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder">Challenges</h2>
                        <p>One significant challenge was obtaining reliable and timely data that aligned music trends with specific economic events. Additionally, sentiment analysis in music is subjective—some songs have upbeat melodies but carry melancholic lyrics. To overcome this, I combined audio feature analysis (tempo, key, and mode) with lyric sentiment data to ensure a more accurate classification of songs.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder">Results</h2>
                        <p>The model ultimately revealed a compelling result: During times of economic hardship, people tend to gravitate toward happier music. This finding suggests that listeners use upbeat music as a form of emotional upliftment and escapism during challenging periods. The research supports the idea that music serves as a psychological buffer against external stressors.</p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder">Key Takeaways</h2>
                        <p>This project reinforced my skills in data analysis, sentiment analysis, and model development using Python. More importantly, it deepened my understanding of how external societal factors can influence personal behavior and cultural trends. In the future, I would like to expand this research by including different cultural contexts and analyzing genre-specific trends.</p>
